# Software Engineering Team Organizer

This program allows a project manager to organize a software development team. The program uses Node.js to obtain info from the user in the terminal. The manager must enter themself and at least one other member of the team. The other members are either engineers or interns. The manager can enter as many engineers and interns as they please. The js file writes to a file called team.html which will display the information.

## Classes
Classes were created for each employee and this class was extended into more specific employee rolls such as manager, intern, and engineer. These classes were used to generate the proper information to write to the team.html file. 

## Testing

Tests were provided to ensure each class was working properly and writing the proper information to the team.html. All tests were passed.
